# 
# This file previously contained 1,094+ lines of functions.
# Functions have been organized into domain-specific files in ~/.config/zsh/functions/
#
# Function categories and their files:

# - dev-tools.zsh  - Development utilities (ya, yad, clean_monorepo, etc.)
# - dotfiles.zsh   - Dotfiles management (dfs, dfca, dfmod)
# - git.zsh        - Git operations (gcaa, og, gcd, gstats, etc.)
# - legacy.zsh     - Deprecated/experimental functions
# - mcp.zsh        - Claude/MCP tools (start-play-mcp, mcp-add)
# - media.zsh      - File/media processing (resizejpg, pngtowebp, etc.)
# - projects.zsh   - Project boilerplates (gcqb, gcnn, gcvb, etc.)
# - ssh.zsh        - SSH operations (ssh-kill, ssh-reconnect, ssh-forward)
# - system.zsh     - System utilities (nr, f, m, newssh, etc.)
# - tmux.zsh       - Tmux management (tm, tswap, tk, start-rolling, etc.)
